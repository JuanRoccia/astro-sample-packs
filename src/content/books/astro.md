## Lyrics

```
[Verse 1]
Astro, take me away
To a place where the stars align
Astro, show me the way
To a world that's beyond space and time

[Chorus]
Astro, take me higher
To a place where the sky's on fire
Astro, show me the light
In the darkness of the night

[Verse 2]
Astro, guide me through
The mysteries of the universe
Astro, show me the truth
In the secrets of the cosmic verse

[Chorus]
Astro, take me higher
To a place where the sky's on fire
Astro, show me the light
In the darkness of the night

[Bridge]
Astro, take me away
To a place where the stars align
Astro, show me the way
To a world that's beyond space and time

[Chorus]
Astro, take me higher
To a place where the sky's on fire
Astro, show me the light
In the darkness of the night

[Outro]
Astro, take me away
To a place where the stars align
Astro, show me the way
To a world that's beyond space and time
